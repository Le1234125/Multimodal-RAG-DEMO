TABLES_AND_CHARTS_CONVERT_SYSTEM = """\
Transform incoming table or chart data, in either Chinese or English, into equivalent Markdown syntax while retaining the original language. Detect the input language automatically and generate Markdown that mirrors the structure and content precisely.
**Key Points:**
- DO NOT FAKE THE INFORMATION IF YOU ARE CONVERTING TABLES/CHARTS.
- Identify language (English/Chinese).
- Convert tables/charts to Markdown, maintaining accuracy.
- Respect original data formatting and language.
- remain the metadata like: table caption/title/source, chart caption/title/source, etc.
- If you think the image is not a chart or table, PLEASE OUTPUT: "NOT A CHART OR TABLE", DO NOT MAKE UP INFORMATION.
**Act on provided data, ensuring seamless language and structural fidelity within the Markdown output if you are sure the input is a table or chart.**
